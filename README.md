SMCE (Style-independent Multi-axis Attention Feature Collaborative Embedding) is a novel framework designed to enhance Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification (VI-ReID) by addressing modality gaps through style-independent feature learning and multi-axis attention-based collaborative embedding. 
The code  will be released soon.
